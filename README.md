* **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can view all bookings across the platform.

### Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
* **RESTful API:** A well-structured API for all application functions.
* **Database Transactions:** Ensures data integrity for critical operations like booking appointments.
* **Security:** Implements JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies, password hashing with `bcryptjs`, rate limiting, and security headers with `helmet`.
* **Modular Code:** Organized into separate layers for routes, models, middleware, and configuration.

### Frontend (React.js)
* **Responsive Design:** A mobile-friendly user interface.
* **State Management:** Uses React Context API for global authentication state.
* **Protected Routes:** Ensures users can only access pages based on their authentication status and role.

## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
* **npm**
* **MongoDB** installed and running locally, or a connection string for a cloud-hosted instance.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/adityanathjha02/Booking-Appointment.git](https://github.com/adityanathjha02/Booking-Appointment.git)
cd Booking-Appointment
````

### 2\. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a **`.env`** file in the `backend` directory and add your configuration details:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/appointment-booking # Or your cloud MongoDB URI
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Note:** For Google OAuth, set up your credentials in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). The `callbackURL` should be `/api/auth/google/callback`.

### 3\. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `frontend` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create a **`.env`** file in the `frontend` directory:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 4\. Running the Application

You will need at least three terminal windows for this step.

**Terminal 1: Start MongoDB**

  * Ensure your MongoDB instance is running.

**Terminal 2: Start the Backend**

  * Navigate to the `backend` directory.
  * Seed the database with sample data (optional but recommended for testing).
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```
  * Start the backend server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

**Terminal 3: Start the Frontend**

  * Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìù Notes on Trade-offs & Next Steps

### Trade-offs

  * **OTP delivery:** Currently, the OTP is printed to the console for demonstration. In a production environment, this should be replaced with a secure email or SMS service to prevent security risks.
  * **Error Handling:** While the application has basic error handling, a more robust system would include a centralized logger and more specific client-side error messages.

### Next Steps

  * **Email Integration:** Integrate a service like SendGrid or Nodemailer for sending OTPs and booking confirmations.
  * **Calendar View:** Add a more user-friendly calendar interface on the frontend for selecting appointment dates.
  * **Cancellation Feature:** Implement an endpoint and frontend logic for users to cancel their appointments.
  * **Deployment:** Create deployment pipelines (e.g., Docker) and host the application on a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel.
